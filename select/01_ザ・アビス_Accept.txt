The future is predestined
The writing's on the wall
Can you see the telltale signs?
The turning point has come
Here it comes

Suicide bombs exploding
As missiles crack the sky
Earthquakes and tsunamis
Signal the end of time
In the here
And the now
Feel the fear
It's all coming down
The world is turning
Turning inside out
The world is burning
It's burning on somehow
But it's broken, It's burning
Goin' up in flames!

Can we change the path we're on
Somehow turn the tide
Smother the all-consuming fire
Before the world collides
With the here
And the now
Feel the fear
All coming down
The world is turning
Turning inside out
The world is burning
It's burning on somehow
The world is turning
Turning inside out
The world is burning
It's burning on somehow
But it's broken, It's burning
Goin' up in flames!

Do you remember bluer skies
Happy days and simpler times
Seems not that long ago
But so far away
Will it ever be the same again?
I don't think so

'Cause it's here
And it's now
Feel the fear
All coming down
The world is turning
It's turning inside out
The world is burning
It's burning on somehow
But it's broken, It's burning
Goin' up in flames
Up in flames!

Goin' up in flames!
